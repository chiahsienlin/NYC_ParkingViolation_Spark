# NYC ParkingViolation Spark

## Using Spark to explore NYC Parking Violations
* This is the Assignment of Big Data.  In this assignment, we analyze different aspects of parking violations in NYC using Spark and python. We write pyspark programs using both RDDs and DataFrames for 7 different tasks
* The data we use is open and available from NYC Open Data at:
  * https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2016/kiv2-tbus/data
  * https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Open-Parking-and-Camera-Violations/nc67-uf89

## Environment
* We run and test our tasks on the Dumbo which is our 48-node Hadoop cluster, running Cloudera CDH 5.9.0 (Hadoop 2.6.0 with Yarn).
